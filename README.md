 Gesture-Controlled Device Management with Hand Tracking and Computer Vision

 Project Description

This project utilizes computer vision and hand tracking technology to provide intuitive, gesture-based control for managing system parameters like volume and brightness. Using OpenCV and the Mediapipe library, the system detects hand movements in real-time through a webcam, allowing users to adjust settings simply by moving their hands. Additionally, it integrates `pycaw` to control system volume and `screen_brightness_control` to manage screen brightness, providing a seamless and interactive experience. This project is ideal for anyone interested in combining computer vision with practical device control applications.

 Features

- Gesture-based volume control: Adjust the system's volume by controlling the thumb and index finger distance.
- Gesture-based brightness control: Hand gestures adjust the screen brightness.
- Screenshot functionality: Take a screenshot using hand gestures.
- Real-time interaction: Works through a webcam with real-time hand tracking and system interaction.
- Cross-platform compatibility: Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS (with appropriate dependencies).

 Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.6+
- OpenCV
- Mediapipe
- pycaw (for Windows volume control)
- screen_brightness_control

You can install the dependencies via pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
